# Module-8-Journal
This repository gives a brief glimpse of what I have learned in my software development course. 

**Questions**
**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
I interpret user needs based upon the needs and expectations of stakeholders. Generally, speaking since software development
is involved in the majority of the tech hub, I want to be able to use my creativity and critical thinking to create products 
that are in high quality. The process of creating "user stories" helps to break down client requests into small, manageable tasks, 
so that developers can bring full-face value to a project/product. It's also imperative that user stories are written in abstract,
non-technical lanaguage, so that developers and stakeholders can comprehend collectively what is being observed for the project to 
commence. User stories helps to guide the development process, so that developers can have a clear pathway on where to start, and how
to manage a development project.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
My approach to developing programs, stems from iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration with both team
members and stakeholders. Agile processes such as Scrum, help to offer a balanced and consistent approach of delivering
project value in increments. This makes it easier to adapt to the change of client requirements, aside from the Waterfall
method which is the complete opposite. In future aspects, I want to include Agile in workstyle, because of how I can benefit
from in my future career. The people that I work with later on in the years, will succeed in teamwork, communication, balance, 
and collaboration because there is structured order and leadership. That also includes having tasks prioritized, so that they
can be tracked for completion. 

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
Being a good team member in software development means to be able to acknowledge feedback from team members and clients, 
take responsibility for what could go wrong in a project, being able to adapt to new changes, and etc. Additonally, it also 
includes being punctual in daily stand-up meetings, so that one can be able to build the skills needed to communicate 
effectively. Lastly, being able to have great documentation skills is a must in software development, because it allows 
developers to borrow and reference designs, instead of wasting time. Documentation would have designs, details of a system, and 
other necessary information to make sure that developers know what they need.
